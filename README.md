I am a 6th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. I work with Najim Dehak and Jes√∫s Villalba at the Center for Language and Speech Processing. I am currently focussed on  adapting speaker recognition systems to far-field and noisy data using unsupervised techniques. I am also working on dealing with channel mismatch. Earlier I have worked with Prof. Hynek Hermansky with research focussed on noise robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). I also collaborate with Dan Povey on developing an augmentation recipe for ASR. My contributions to Kaldi can be found on [my github](https://github.com/phanisankar-nidadavolu/kaldi/commits/augmentation-script-asr-spkrid "Augmentation Recipe").
